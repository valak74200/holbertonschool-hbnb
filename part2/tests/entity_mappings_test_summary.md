# Entity Mappings Test Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing of entity mappings in the HBnB application. The tests were performed to verify that the database tables were correctly created based on the defined models and that CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) work properly for each entity.

## Entities Tested

1. **User**
   - Model: `User`
   - Table: `users`
   - Fields: id, first_name, last_name, email, password, role, is_admin, created_at, updated_at
   - Operations Tested: Create, Read, Update

2. **Amenity**
   - Model: `Amenity`
   - Table: `amenities`
   - Fields: id, name, created_at, updated_at
   - Operations Tested: Create, Read, Update

3. **Place**
   - Model: `Place`
   - Table: `places`
   - Fields: id, title, description, price, latitude, longitude, owner_id, created_at, updated_at
   - Operations Tested: Create, Read, Update

4. **Review**
   - Model: `Review`
   - Table: `reviews`
   - Fields: id, text, rating, place_id, user_id, created_at, updated_at
   - Operations Tested: Create, Read, Update, Delete

## Testing Methodology

1. **Database Initialization**
   - The database was initialized using Flask's application context and SQLAlchemy's `db.create_all()` to create the tables based on the defined models.

2. **CRUD Operations Testing**
   - For each entity, the following operations were tested:
     - **Create**: Adding new records to the database
     - **Read**: Retrieving records from the database
     - **Update**: Modifying existing records in the database
     - **Delete**: Removing records from the database (tested for Review entity)

3. **Testing Tools**
   - Manual testing using Python scripts
   - cURL commands for API endpoint testing
   - Database queries to verify the state of the database

## Test Results

The tests confirmed that:

1. All entity models are correctly mapped to database tables
2. CRUD operations work as expected for all entities
3. Relationships between entities are properly established:
   - User to Place (one-to-many)
   - Place to Review (one-to-many)
   - User to Review (one-to-many)
   - Place to Amenity (many-to-many)

## Database State After Testing

After running the tests, the database contains:
- Multiple User records
- Place records with proper owner associations
- Amenity records
- No Review records (as they were deleted during testing)

## Conclusion

The entity mappings are working correctly, and the application's data layer is functioning as expected. The database schema accurately reflects the application's domain model, and the CRUD operations are properly implemented for all entities.
