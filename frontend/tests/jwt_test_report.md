# JWT Authentication Test Report

## Overview

This report documents the implementation and testing of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in the HBnB API. JWT authentication provides a secure way to authenticate users and protect sensitive endpoints while allowing public access to non-sensitive data.

## Implementation Details

### Libraries and Tools

- **flask-jwt-extended**: Used for JWT authentication implementation
- **Python requests**: Used for testing API endpoints
- **curl**: Used for command-line testing of API endpoints
- **jq**: Used for JSON parsing in shell scripts

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**: Users register by providing their first name, last name, email, and password.
2. **User Login**: Users login with their email and password to receive a JWT token.
3. **Protected Endpoints**: Protected endpoints require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.
4. **Public Endpoints**: Public endpoints do not require authentication.

### Protected vs. Public Endpoints

#### Protected Endpoints (Require JWT Authentication)

- **POST /api/v1/places/**: Create a new place
- **PUT /api/v1/places/<place_id>**: Update a place (only the owner can update)
- **POST /api/v1/reviews/**: Create a new review
- **PUT /api/v1/reviews/<review_id>**: Update a review (only the author can update)
- **DELETE /api/v1/reviews/<review_id>**: Delete a review (only the author can delete)
- **PUT /api/v1/users/<user_id>**: Update a user (users can only update their own profile)
- **POST /api/v1/amenities/**: Create a new amenity
- **PUT /api/v1/amenities/<amenity_id>**: Update an amenity

#### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)

- **GET /api/v1/places/**: Retrieve a list of all places
- **GET /api/v1/places/<place_id>**: Retrieve details of a specific place
- **GET /api/v1/places/<place_id>/reviews**: Retrieve reviews for a specific place
- **GET /api/v1/reviews/**: Retrieve a list of all reviews
- **GET /api/v1/reviews/<review_id>**: Retrieve details of a specific review
- **GET /api/v1/users/**: Retrieve a list of all users
- **GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>**: Retrieve details of a specific user
- **GET /api/v1/amenities/**: Retrieve a list of all amenities
- **GET /api/v1/amenities/<amenity_id>**: Retrieve details of a specific amenity

## Testing Methodology

### Test Scripts

1. **Python Test Scripts**:
   - `test_auth.py`: Tests the basic authentication flow
   - `test_jwt_places.py`: Tests JWT authentication for place endpoints
   - `test_jwt_reviews.py`: Tests JWT authentication for review endpoints
   - `test_jwt_users.py`: Tests JWT authentication for user endpoints
   - `test_jwt_amenities.py`: Tests JWT authentication for amenity endpoints

2. **Shell Scripts**:
   - `run_jwt_tests.sh`: Runs all Python test scripts sequentially
   - `curl_jwt_tests.sh`: Tests JWT authentication using curl commands

### Test Cases

#### Authentication Tests

- Creating a user
- Logging in to get a JWT token
- Accessing a protected endpoint with the JWT token

#### Authorization Tests

- Creating resources as an authenticated user
- Attempting to create resources without authentication (should fail)
- Updating resources as the owner
- Attempting to update resources as a non-owner (should fail)
- Deleting resources as the owner
- Attempting to delete resources as a non-owner (should fail)
- Accessing public endpoints without authentication

#### Validation Tests

- Attempting to review one's own place (should fail)
- Attempting to create multiple reviews for the same place (should fail)
- Attempting to modify email or password through the user update endpoint (should fail)

## Conclusion

The JWT authentication implementation in the HBnB API successfully:

1. **Authenticates users** and provides JWT tokens upon successful login
2. **Protects sensitive endpoints** that modify data
3. **Enforces authorization rules** to ensure users can only modify their own resources
4. **Allows public access** to non-sensitive data
5. **Validates input** to prevent unauthorized actions

All test cases passed, confirming that the JWT authentication system is working as expected. The implementation follows best practices for API security, including:

- Using JWT for stateless authentication
- Protecting sensitive endpoints
- Implementing proper authorization checks
- Providing clear error messages for unauthorized actions
- Keeping non-sensitive data publicly accessible

## Recommendations

1. **Token Expiration**: Consider implementing token expiration and refresh tokens for enhanced security.
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Consider implementing roles (e.g., admin, user) for more granular access control.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
4. **HTTPS**: Ensure the API is served over HTTPS in production to protect JWT tokens in transit.
5. **Logging**: Implement logging for authentication and authorization events for security monitoring.
